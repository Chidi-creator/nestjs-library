# üìö NestJS Library API


This is a simple Library Management API I built as part of my journey learning the **NestJS** framework. I just recently started using NestJS, and I wanted to put my new knowledge into practice by building something meaningful ‚Äî so I created this library system.

## üöÄ What I Learned & Implemented

- ‚úÖ **NestJS fundamentals** ‚Äì Modules, Controllers, Services, DTOs, etc.
- üîê **Authentication** ‚Äì Implemented using **Passport.js with JWT strategy**
- üõ°Ô∏è **Authorization** ‚Äì Built using **custom decorators** and **guards**
  - I created a custom `@Roles()` decorator
  - Set up a `RolesGuard` to restrict access based on user roles like `admin`, `moderator`, and `user`

## üì¶ Features

- Users can **sign up** and **log in**
- Authenticated users can **create**, **read**, and manage **books**
- Role-based access control on protected routes (e.g., only certain roles can access specific endpoints)
- Clean, scalable backend structure using best practices from NestJS

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **NestJS** (Node.js framework)
- **Mongoose** (MongoDB ODM)
- **Passport.js** (for authentication)
- **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens for secure sessions

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
